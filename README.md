# The G20: A Military, Educational, and Healthcare Perspective

Welcome! You are now browsing at a visual presentation analyzing a select number of countries who are members of the G20 forum. The data assembled covers the following nations: Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). Over the course of this presentation, you will have the opportunity to explore these nations' trends in military, education, and healthcare spending from 2013 to 2017, and grasp at these variables' relationships with their respective economies.

## Preparing Our Data

Our data for GDP, population, and military and healthcare spending from 2013 to 2017 can be found at the World Bank's Indicator files. Figures representing the educational shares of GDP were located at several other sources. While China's figures were posted on Statista, the US reported its current educational expenditures at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' Economic Data page, which were then used to calculate its GDP shares over our timespan of interest. As for the other countries in our study, their shares were reported from the data site Knoema. 

Regarding the latter, as an important sidenote, Japan and South Korea's educational shares were missing in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Thus, during the data cleanup stage, these were adjusted by calculating the means for the other four years that already included figures for both countries. 

The Jupyter Notebook outlining the process of cleaning up the data prior to being exported to Excel and Google Sheets is available for you to view.

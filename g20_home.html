            <h1>The G20: A Visualized Overview from 2013 to 2017</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome!
                You are now browsing at a visual presentation analyzing a select number of countries who are members of the G20 forum.  
                The data assembled covers the following nations: Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US).  
                Over the course of this presentation, you will have the opportunity to explore these nations' trends in military, education, and healthcare spending from 2013 to 2017, and grasp at these variables' relationships with their respective economies.  
                Refer to the menu-bar located at the top for your studies.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Our data for GDP, population, and military and healthcare spending from 2013 to 2017 can be found at the World Bank's Indicator files.  
                Figures representing the educational shares of GDP were located at several other sources.  
                While China's figures were posted on Statista, the US reported its current educational expenditures at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' Economic Data page, which were then used to calculate its GDP shares over our timespan of interest.  
                As for the other countries in our study, their shares were reported from the data site Knoema.
                Regarding the latter, as an important sidenote, Japan and South Korea's educational shares were missing in 2015 and 2017, respectively.  
                Thus, during the data cleanup stage, these were adjusted by calculating the means for the other four years that already included figures for both countries.
                References for this project are included under its corresponding tab.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a little background, let's report on the rates of GDP and population growth among the nations listed between 2013 and 2017.
            </p>
            <h2>Rate of GDP Growth across the G20 Forum (2013 - 2017)</h2>
            <div id="gdp_pct_change_div" style="width: 880px; height:500px;"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                As shown by the green geographic chart, the majority of countries actually saw their economies decline in terms of their GDP growth rates.
                However, the three outliers - China, South Korea, and the US - expanded at relatively high rates, at 28.63%, 18.46%, and 16.29%, respectively.
                Note as well how four European countries - France, Germany, Italy, and the UK - shrank at some level between 1% and 8.50% from 2013 to 2017.
            </p>
            <h2>Rate of Population Growth across the G20 Forum (2013 - 2017)</h2>
            <div id="population_pct_change_div" style="width: 880px; height:500px;"></div>
            <br>
            <p>
                On the other hand, every country except Japan witnessed a rise in its population over our time span.
                Taken alongside our findings for GDP growth, we can deduce that the GDP per capita in most nations shrank from 2013 to 2017.
                This is likely the case with Australia in particular, whose economy declined by more than 15% despite its population rising by more than 6%.
